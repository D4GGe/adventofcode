    "<article class=\"day-desc\"><h2>--- Day 3: Spiral Memory ---</h2><p>You come across an experimental new kind of memory stored on an <span title=\"Good thing we have all these infinite two-dimensional grids lying around!\">infinite two-dimensional grid</span>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Each square on the grid is allocated in a spiral pattern starting at a location marked <code>1</code> and then counting up while spiraling outward. For example, the first few squares are allocated like this:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>17  16  15  14  13\n",
    "18   5   4   3  12\n",
    "19   6   1   2  11\n",
    "20   7   8   9  10\n",
    "21  22  23---&gt; ...\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>While this is very space-efficient (no squares are skipped), requested data must be carried back to square <code>1</code> (the location of the only access port for this memory system) by programs that can only move up, down, left, or right. They always take the shortest path: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry\">Manhattan Distance</a> between the location of the data and square <code>1</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>For example:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Data from square <code>1</code> is carried <code>0</code> steps, since it's at the access port.</li>\n",
    "<li>Data from square <code>12</code> is carried <code>3</code> steps, such as: down, left, left.</li>\n",
    "<li>Data from square <code>23</code> is carried only <code>2</code> steps: up twice.</li>\n",
    "<li>Data from square <code>1024</code> must be carried <code>31</code> steps.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p><em>How many steps</em> are required to carry the data from the square identified in your puzzle input all the way to the access port?</p>\n",
    "</article>\n",
    "<p>Your puzzle input is <code class=\"puzzle-input\">265149</code>.</p>"
